%% (OPTIONAL) CONVENIENCE VARIABLE: Only relevant when you use Maneage's
%% '\includetikz' macro to build plots/figures within LaTeX using TikZ or
%% PGFPlots. If so, when the Figure files (PDFs) are already built, you can
%% avoid TikZ or PGFPlots completely by commenting/removing the definition
%% of '\makepdf' below. This is useful when you don't want to slow-down a
%% LaTeX-only build of the project (for example this happens when you run
%% './project make dist'). See the definition of '\includetikz' in
%% 'tex/preamble-pgfplots.tex' for more.
\newcommand{\makepdf}{}

%% VALUES FROM ANALYSIS (NUMBERS AND STRINGS): this file is automatically
%% generated at the end of the processing and includes LaTeX macros
%% (defined with '\newcommand') for various processing outputs to be used
%% within the paper.
\input{tex/build/macros/project.tex}

%% MANEAGE-ONLY PREAMBLE: this file contains LaTeX constructs that are
%% provided by Maneage (for example enabling or disabling of highlighting
%% from the './project' script). They are not style-related.
\input{tex/src/preamble-maneage.tex}

%% PROJECT-SPECIFIC PREAMBLE: This is where you can include any LaTeX
%% setting for customizing your project.

You can use Figures like Figure \ref{fig:image-histogram}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includetikz{delete-me-image-histogram}{width=\linewidth}

  \caption{\label{fig:image-histogram} (a) An example image of the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2, on board the Hubble Space Telescope from 1993 to 2009.
    This is one of the sample images from the FITS standard webpage, kept as examples for this file format.
