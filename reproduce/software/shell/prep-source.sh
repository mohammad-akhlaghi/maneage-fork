# Find all the files that contain the '/bin/sh' or '/bin/bash' strings and
# correct them to Maneage's own shell (Dash or Bash). We are using 'while
# read' to read the file names line by line. This is necessary to account
# file names that include the 'SPACE' character (happens in CMake for
# example!).
#
# Note that dates are important in the source directory (files depend on
# each other), so we should read the original date and after making. We are
# also not using GNU SED's '-i' ('--in-place') option because the host OS
# may not have GNU SED.
#
# The situation which prompted the addition of this step: a Maneage'd
# project (with GNU Bash 5.1.8 and Readline 8.1.1) was being built on a
# system where '/bin/sh' was GNU Bash 5.2.26 and had Readline 8.2.010. The
# newer version of Bash needed the newer Readline library function(s) that
# were not available in Maneage's Readline library. Therefore, as soon as
# the basic software were built and Maneage entered the creation of
# high-level software (where we completely close-off the host environment),
# Maneage crashed with the following '/bin/sh' error:
#
#   /bin/sh: symbol lookup error: /bin/sh: undefined symbol: rl_trim_arg_from_keyseq
#
# This lead to the discovery that through '/bin/sh' the host operating
# system was leaking into our closed Maneage environment which needs to be
# closed. This needs a source-level correction because '/bin/sh' is
# hard-coded in the source code of almost all programs (their build
# scripts); and in special programs like GNU Make, GNU M4 or CMake it is
# actually hardcoded in the source code (not just build scripts).
