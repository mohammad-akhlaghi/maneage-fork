# Check file permission handling (POSIX-compatibility)
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Check if a 'given' directory handles permissions as expected.
#
# This is to prevent a known bug in the NTFS filesystem that prevents
# proper installation of Perl, and probably some other packages. This
# function receives the directory as an argument and then, creates a dummy
# file, and examines whether the given directory handles the file
# permissions as expected.
#
# Returns '0' if everything is fine, and '255' otherwise. Choosing '0' is
# to mimic the '$ echo $?' behavior, while choosing '255' is to prevent
# misunderstanding 0 and 1 as true and false.
#
# ===== CAUTION! ===== #
#
# Since there is a 'set -e' before running this function, the whole script
# stops and exits IF the 'check_permission' (or any other function) returns
# anything OTHER than '0'! So, only use this function as a test. Here's a
# minimal example:
#
#     if $(check_permission $some_directory) ; then
#       echo "yay"; else "nay";
#     fi ;
check_permission ()
{
    # Make a 'junk' file, activate its executable flag and record its
    # permissions generally.
    local junkfile="$1"/check_permission_tmp_file
    rm -f "$junkfile"
    echo "Don't let my short life go to waste" > "$junkfile"
    chmod +x "$junkfile"
    local perm_before=$(ls -l "$junkfile" | awk '{print $1}')

    # Now, remove the executable flag and record the permissions.
    chmod -x "$junkfile"
    local perm_after=$(ls -l "$junkfile" | awk '{print $1}')

    # Clean up before leaving the function
    rm -f "$junkfile"

    # If the permissions are equal, the filesystem doesn't allow
    # permissions.
    if [ $perm_before = $perm_after ]; then
        # Setting permission FAILED
        return 1
    else
        # Setting permission SUCCESSFUL
        return 0
    fi
}





# Check if there is enough free space available in the build directory
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Use this function to check if there is enough free space in a
# directory. It is meant to be passed to the 'if' statement in the
# shell. So if there is enough space, it returns 0 (which translates to
# TRUE), otherwise, the funcion returns 1 (which translates to FALSE).
#
# Expects to be called with two arguments, the first is the threshold and
# the second is the desired directory. The 'df' function checks the given
# path to see where it is mounted on, and how much free space there is on
# that partition (in units of 1024 bytes).
#
# synopsis:
# $ free_space_warning <acceptable_threshold> <path-to-check>
#
# example:
# To check if there is 5MB of space available in /path/to/check
# call the command with arguments as shown below:
# $ free_space_warning 5000 /path/to/check/free/space
free_space_warning()

The 'sys/cdefs.h' header cannot be included, or a usable static C library
('libc.a', in any directory) cannot be used with the current settings of
this system. SEE THE ERROR MESSAGE ABOVE.

Because of this, we can't build GCC. You either 1) don't have them, or 2)
the default system environment aren't enough to find them.

1) If you don't have them, your operating system provides them as separate
packages that you must manually install. Please look into your operating
system documentation or contact someone familiar with it. For example on
some Redhat-based GNU/Linux distributions, the static C library package can
be installed with this command:

    $ sudo yum install glibc-static

2) If you have 'libc.a' and 'sys/cdefs.h', but in a non-standard location (for
example in '/PATH/TO/STATIC/LIBC/libc.a' and
'/PATH/TO/SYS/CDEFS_H/sys/cdefs.h'), please run the commands below, then
re-configure the project to fix this problem.

    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/PATH/TO/STATIC/LIBC \$LDFLAGS"
    $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/PATH/TO/SYS/CDEFS_H \$LDFLAGS"

===============
Build directory
===============

The project's "source" (this directory) and "build" directories are treated
separately. This greatly helps in managing the many intermediate files that
are created during the build. The intermediate build files don't need to be
archived or backed up: you can always re-build them with the contents of
the source directory. The build directory also needs a fairly large amount
of free space (at least several gigabytes), while the source directory (all
plain text, ignoring the .git directory if you have it) will usually be a
megabyte or less.

The link '.build' (a symbolic link to the build directory) will be created
during this configuration. It can help encourage you to set the actual
build directory to a very different path to that of the source (the build
directory should be considered as a large volume directory of throwaway
space that can be casually deleted), while making it easy to access from
here without having to remember the particular path.

--- CAUTION ---
Do not choose any directory under the top source directory (this
directory). The build directory cannot be a subdirectory of the source.
---------------

Build directory:
  - Must be writable by running user.
  - Not a sub-directory of the source directory.
  - No meta-characters in name: SPACE ! ' @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + ;

To ensure an identical build environment, the project will use its own
build of the programs it needs. Therefore the tarball of the relevant
programs are necessary.

If you don't specify any directory here, or it doesn't contain the tarball
of a dependency, it is necessary to have an internet connection because the
project will download the tarballs it needs automatically.

# Libraries necessary for the system's shell
# ------------------------------------------
#
# In some cases (mostly the programs that Maneage doesn't yet build by
# itself), the programs may call the system's shell, not Maneage's
# shell. After we close-off the system environment from Maneage, this will
# cause a crash! To avoid such cases, we need to find the locations of the
# libraries that the shell needs and temporarily add them to the library
# search path.
#
# About the 'grep -v "(0x[^)]*)"' term (from bug 66847, see [1]): On some
# systems [2], the output of 'ldd /bin/sh' includes a line for the vDSO [3]
# that is different to the formats that are assumed, prior to this commit,
# by the algorithm in 'configure.sh' when evaluating the variable
# 'sys_library_sh_path'. This leads to a fatal syntax error in (at least)
# 'ncurses', because the option using 'sys_library_sh_path' contains an
# unquoted RAM address in parentheses. Even if the address were quoted, it
# would still be incorrect. This 'grep' command excludes candidate host
# path strings that look like RAM addresses to address the problem.

# Find Zenodo URL for software downloading
# ----------------------------------------
#
# All free-software source tarballs that are potentially used in Maneage
# are also archived in Zenodo with a certain concept-DOI. A concept-DOI is
# a Zenodo terminology, meaning a fixed DOI of the project (that can have
# many sub-DOIs for different versions). By default, the concept-DOI points
# to the most recently uploaded version. However, the concept-DOI itself is
# not directly usable for downloading files. The concept-DOI will just take
# us to the top webpage of the most recent version of the upload.
#
# The problem is that as more software are added (as new Zenodo versions),
# the most recent Zenodo-URL that the concept-DOI points to, also
# changes. The most reliable solution was found to be the tiny script below
# which will download the DOI-resolved webpage, and extract the Zenodo-URL
# of the most recent version from there (using the 'coreutils' tarball as
# an example, the directory part of the URL for all the other software are
# the same). This is not done if the options '--debug' or `--offline` are
# used.
#
# NOTE on commented region below (starting with '##'): As described [1],
# Zenodo's upload strategy does not allow a repository with more than one

# Make sure TeX Live installed successfully

# TeX Live is managed over the internet, so if there isn't any, or it
# suddenly gets cut, it can't be built. However, when TeX Live isn't
# installed, the project can do all its processing independent of it. It
# will just stop at the stage when all the processing is complete and it is
# only necessary to build the PDF.  So we don't want to stop the project's
# configuration and building if its not present.

______________________________________________________
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        Warning        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

TeX Live couldn't be installed during the configuration (probably because
there were downloading problems, or you used the '--offline' option). TeX
Live is only necessary in making the final PDF (which is only done after
all the analysis has been complete). It is not used at all during the
analysis.

Therefore, if you don't need the final PDF, and just want to do the
analysis, you can safely ignore this warning and continue.

If you later have internet access and would like to add TeX Live to your
project, then please delete the following two files:

    rm .local/version-info/tex/texlive-ready-tlmgr
    rm .build/software/tarballs/install-tl-unx.tar.gz

and re-run configure:

    ./project configure -e

The configuration will continue in $pausesec seconds. To avoid the pause on
such messages use the '--no-pause' option.

----------------
The project and its environment are configured with no errors.

To change the configuration later, you can re-run './project configure' or
manually edit 'reproduce/software/config/LOCAL.conf'. Just be careful with
the build-directory: its location is hard-coded in the installed software
so if you change it manually, many of the project's software will crash. If
you have to use another built-directory, just re-configure a clean project
there.

Please run the following command to start the project.
(Replace '8' with the number of CPU threads on your system)
