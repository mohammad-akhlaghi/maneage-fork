# Server authentication/identification
# ------------------------------------
#
# If you need to identify yourself to the database server (when downloading
# input files), you can write your user name and password in the two
# variables below. When these two variables are defined, the download rule
# (in 'reproduce/analysis/make/initialize.mk') will pass their values to
# the '--user' and '--password' options of WGET.\
#
# The 'DATABASEAUTHTYPE' specifies which type of authentication is
# recognized by the database with the 'wget' command. It can take the
# following values:
#   'userpass': Assumes --user='XXXX' --password='YYYY'
#   'postdata': Assumes --post-data 'username=XXXX&password=YYYY'
#
# SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN PASSWORD: if your password has special characters
# like '#' or '$' (that can have special meaning for Make), then comment
# them with a back-slash. For example if your password is 'ab#cd', write it
# below as 'ab\#cd'. Within 'initialize.mk', the user name and password are
# placed inside single quotes before being used, so special characters
# won't be problematic. However, if your password includes characters like
# the single quote itself, this can be problematic. In this case, you can
# temporarily (without committing!) directly enter the password in the
# respective rule of 'initialize.mk' and after downloading, undo the change
# (which is easy with 'git restore'). If you have any ideas on how to
# account for such characters in a generic way, please let us know and
# we'll suggest them here for future users.
#
# SECURITY WARNING: only set the values of these two variables in
# 'LOCAL.conf' (which is _not_ under version control), _not_
# 'LOCAL.conf.in' (which is under version control). It is also recommended
# to remove the ID and password values from 'LOCAL.conf' immediately after
# your downloads finish: even though 'LOCAL.conf' is not under version
# control, it will still be on your computer, which may be accessed by
# others or (mistakenly) shared with others.
