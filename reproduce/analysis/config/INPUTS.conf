# This project's input file information (metadata).
#
# For each input (external) data file that is used within the project,
# three variables are suggested here (only the verification variable is
# strictly mandatory). These variables will be used by the download rule of
# 'reproduce/analysis/make/initialize.mk' to import the dataset into the
# project (within the build directory):
#
#   - If the file already exists locally in '$(INDIR)' (the optional input
#     directory that may have been specified at configuration time with
#     '--input-dir'), a symbolic link will be added in '$(indir)' (in the
#     build directory). A symbolic link is used to avoid extra storage when
#     files are large.
#
#   - If the file doesn't exist in '$(INDIR)', or no input directory was
#     specified at configuration time, then the file is downloaded from the
#     specified URL for that dataset.
#
# In both cases, before placing the file (or its link) in the build
# directory, the download rule of 'reproduce/analysis/make/initialize.mk'
# will check the verification of the dataset and if it differs from the
# pre-defined value (set for that file, here), it will abort (since this is
# not the intended dataset).
#
# Verification (two modes)
# ------------------------
#   - SHA256 checksum. This will check the full contents of the file, and
#     is generic to any data format. However, if the server inserts custom
#     headers like the query date or query code and etc, this form of
#     validation is not useful: because every download will have different
#     headers. In such cases, you should use the other verification methods
#     below. In other words, this method is only good for files that are
#     "static" on the server (and left there unchanged). If the file is
#     generated at request time, the server usually inserts custom run-time
#     dependent headers; making it impossible to verify with an SHA
#     checksum of the whole file.
#   - The FITS Standard's 'DATASUM' (which will only check the data, not
#     the headers). According to the FITS standard, this sum ignores all
#     headers, and is only calculated on a HDU's data. By default, this
#     will require Gnuastro (which can easily calculate and return the
#     value on the command-line), and it assumes HDU number 1 (counting
#     from 0). You can modify the defaults by modifying the rule in
#     'reproduce/analysis/make/initialize.mk'.
#
# Automatic writing of verification
# ---------------------------------
# In case you would like Maneage to find the checksum upon downloading, put
# the string '--auto-replace--' instead of a checksum. This can be helpful
# for large datasets; where downloading only for adding the checksum is not
# easy/possible and can be buggy. In this scenario, upon downloading the
# file its checksum will be calculated and will be replaced with the
# '--auto-replace--' in this file. But since this file is under version
# control, be sure to commit all the updated checksums after your downloads
# are finished!
#
# Variable description
# --------------------
# The naming convension is critical for the input files to be properly
# imported into Maneage. In the patterns below, the '%' is the full file
# name (including its suffix): for example in the demo input of this file
# in the 'maneage' branch, we have 'INPUT-wfpc2.fits-sha256': therefore,
# the input file (within the project's '$(indir)') is called
# 'wfpc2.fits'. This allows you to simply set '$(indir)/wfpc2.fits' as the
# pre-requisite of any recipe that needs the input file: you will rarely
# (if at all!) need to use these variables directly.
#
#   INPUT-%-sha256: The sha256 checksum of the file. You can generate the
#                   SHA256 checksum of a file with the 'sha256sum FILENAME'
#                   command (where 'FILENAME' is the name of your
#                   file). Don't use this if you give the 'fitsdatasum'
#                   keyvalue.
#
#   INPUT-%-fitsdatasum: The FITS standard DATASUM value for HDU number 1
#                        of the FITS file (counting from 0). Don't use this
#                        if you give the 'sha256' keyword.
#
#   INPUT-%-fitshdu: The HDU identifier (counter from 0, or name) to use
#                    for the verification. This is only relevant in the
#                    'fitsdatasum' verification method and optional (if not
#                    given, HDU number 1 is used; counting from 0).
#
#   INPUT-%-url: The URL to download the file if it is not available
#                locally. It can happen that during the first phases of
#                your project the data aren't yet public. In this case, you
#                set a phony URL like this (just as a clear place-holder):
#                'https://this.file/is/not/yet/public'.
#
#   INPUT-%-size: The human-readable size of the file (output of 'ls
#                 -lh'). This is not used by default but can help other
#                 scientists who would like to run your project get a
#                 good feeling of the necessary network and storage
#                 capacity that is necessary to start the project.
#
# Therefore, the the verification variable is MANDATORY in any case. The
# variable with a URL is only necessary if you do not have the file
# locally. However, The size variable is optional (but recommended: because
# it gives future scientists a feeling of the volume of data they need to
# input to run your project: will become important if the size/number of
# files is large).
#
# The input dataset's name (that goes into the '%') can be different from
# the URL's file name (last component of the URL, after the last '/'). Just
# note that it is assumed that the local copy (outside of your project) is
# also called '%' (if your local copy of the input dataset and the only
# repository names are the same, be sure to set '%' accordingly).
