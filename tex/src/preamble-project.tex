%% PGFPlots templates
%% ------------------
%
%% These are ready-made customizations of these two commonly used packages
%% that you can use as a template for your own project: BibLaTeX (advanced
%% bibliography management) or PGFPlots (for drawing plots within LaTeX
%% directly from tables of data). If you don't use them, you can just
%% delete these two lines and also delete their files from your branch (to
%% keep the 'tex/src' directory on your branch clean).
\input{tex/src/preamble-pgfplots.tex}
